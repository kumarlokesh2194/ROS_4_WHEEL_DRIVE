# ROS_4_WHEEL_DRIVE
The repository contains files for simulating a 4 wheel drive in Gazebo using ROS.
For the files to work follow the steps:
1. First place the folders in your environment i.e ~/catkin_ws/src directory.
2. catkin_make
3. Don't forget to source the path by using source ./devel/setup.bash
4. Once finished, for spawning the bot in gazebo run: roslaunch my_gazebo simplediffdrive.launch

Enjoy learning, suggestions are welcomed I Would be updating the repository by adding some more functionality to the 4 wheel drive.
